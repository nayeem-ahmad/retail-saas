# v0.1 Scope: The "Signup-to-Sale" Steel Thread

**Objective:** Validate the core architecture and value proposition by enabling a Shop Owner to onboard themselves, setup a basic catalog, and complete a retail sale.

## 🏗️ Block 1: The Foundation (Infrastructure & Onboarding)

### Story 1.1: Monorepo & Container Infrastructure
*   **Source:** Epic 01 - Story 1.1
*   **Goal:** Establish the technical "plumbing" for the polyglot stack.
*   **Tasks:**
    - Initialize Turborepo with `apps/backend` (NestJS) and `apps/frontend` (Next.js).
    - Create multi-stage Dockerfiles for both services.
    - Setup Render.com pipeline for auto-deployment from `main`.
*   **Success:** A live URL for both API and Frontend showing a "System Health: OK" status.

### Story 1.2: Multi-Tenant Auth & Store Setup
*   **Source:** Epic 01 - Story 1.2
*   **Goal:** Enable secure, isolated store ownership.
*   **Tasks:**
    - Implement User Signup/Login (NestJS + Passport.js/JWT).
    - Implement Store Creation flow (Name, Address, Currency).
    - **Architecture Check:** Ensure the `User` is linked to the `Store` and all subsequent API calls require a valid `store_id` context.
*   **Success:** A Shop Owner can sign up and reach a "Store Dashboard" unique to them.

## 📦 Block 2: The Catalog (Inventory Preparation)

### Story 1.3: Basic Product CRUD & Initial Stock
*   **Source:** Epic 10 - Story 1.3
*   **Goal:** Populate the store with sellable items.
*   **Tasks:**
    - Create API endpoints for Product CRUD.
    - Frontend UI to add/edit products with: Name, SKU, Sale Price, and Initial Stock Level.
    - **Architecture Check:** Product SKUs must be unique *within* a store, but can overlap across different stores.
*   **Success:** The owner can see a list of products with current stock counts.

### Story 5.1: Cloud Asset Storage (Product Images)
*   **Source:** Epic 05 - Story 5.1
*   **Goal:** High-fidelity visual catalog.
*   **Tasks:**
    - Integrate AWS S3 or Cloudinary for image hosting.
    - Enable image upload/preview in the Product CRUD form.
*   **Success:** Product images are displayed correctly in the inventory list and POS.

## 💰 Block 3: The Revenue Loop (The POS Sale)

### Story 1.5: End-to-End POS Transaction
*   **Source:** Epic 10 - Story 1.5
*   **Goal:** The primary revenue-generating action.
*   **Tasks:**
    - Build a "POS" screen with product search/selection.
    - Implement a simple "Cart" logic (Add/Remove/Total).
    - Process a "Complete Sale" action (Cash only for v0.1).
    - **Architecture Check:** Use a PostgreSQL transaction to ensure that the `Sale` record is created AND the `Product` stock is decremented atomically.
*   **Success:** A sale is recorded, and the product stock level is automatically reduced.
