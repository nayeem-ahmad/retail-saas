- [x] Customer payments list + serial numbers — `payment_number` (`CPY-00001`) on `CustomerCreditTransaction` + migration `20260624000000_add_customer_payment_number`; `GET /customers/credit/payments` list endpoint with date/customer/search filters; `recordCreditPayment` assigns payment_number in interactive transaction; Customer Payments page rewritten as DataTable list (serial, date/time, customer, recorded by, amount, notes) with date-range + customer filters and New Payment modal (`?customerId=` + `?new=1` deep links); customer-ledger "Record payment" links to `?customerId=X&new=1`; i18n en/bn/ms — done 2026-06-24
- [x] Customer payment flexibility + accounting — due no longer required to record payment; receive/pay direction (`PAYMENT`/`PAYOUT`, serials `CPY-`/`CPO-`); negative `due_balance` = customer advance; auto-posting via `customer_payment` posting rules (receive: Dr Cash Cr AR, pay: Dr AR Cr Cash) + migration `20260624120000_add_customer_payment_posting`; modal direction selector on Customer Payments page — done 2026-06-24
- [x] Customer payments actions column (view/edit/delete/print) — `GET/PATCH/DELETE /customers/credit/payments/:paymentId`; `updateCreditPayment`/`deleteCreditPayment` reverse `due_balance`, void auto-posted voucher via `voidAutoPostedVoucher`, repost on edit; list enriched with `accounting_voucher_number`; Customer Payments DataTable actions (view modal, edit modal, delete confirm, print money receipt / payment voucher via `customer-payment-receipt.ts`); API client + i18n en/bn/ms; 3 new service specs — done 2026-06-25
- [x] Customer Ledger redesign — removed redundant Back to Sales link; BookOpen icon + header-matching title/subtitle; top filters (customer + date range defaulting 1st→today); single ledger DataTable with opening-balance first row + payment-matching columns (date/time, serial, direction, recorded by, amount, notes, running balance); backend `getCreditLedger` extended with `from`/`to`, `opening_balance`, `closing_balance`, `balance_before` per row — done 2026-06-25
- [x] Enforce `dev` as default development branch — `.githooks` block commits/pushes to `main`; `scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh` + `npm prepare`; branch policy in `CLAUDE.md`; CI runs on `dev` + `main`; GitHub default branch set to `dev` — done 2026-06-25
- [x] Fix New Sale reference-number collision on a new calendar day — `generateReferenceNumber` scoped existing refs to `created_at` today only, but the `YYMM-#` prefix is monthly (e.g. `2606-005` from yesterday still blocks `2606-001` today). Removed the date filter so the max sequence is taken across all refs with the current YYMM prefix; added `generateReferenceNumber()` spec; rebuilt local Docker backend; verified `POST /sales` returns 201 with `2606-006` — done 2026-06-23
- [x] Make New Sale entry actually create sales (3 bugs found by driving the UI end-to-end) — (1) **Product search 500** — Postgres `SUM()` returns a BigInt; `searchByQuantitySold()`'s `.sort((a,b)=>b.qty_sold-a.qty_sold)` threw `Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number`, so the dropdown was empty and no product could be added. Coerce `qty_sold` to `Number()` (`products.service.ts`); also coerce the serialized Decimal `price` to a number on the client (`ProductSearch.tsx`, `page.tsx`). (2) **Create Sale 400** — `CreateSaleDto`/nested DTOs had zero `class-validator` decorators, so the global `ValidationPipe({ whitelist, forbidNonWhitelisted })` rejected every property ("property X should not exist"). Decorated all sale DTOs (`sale.dto.ts`). Frontend also sent `storeId: currentUser?.store_id` which is undefined for owners → now reads the active branch from `localStorage['store_id']` like POS does (`page.tsx`). (3) **2nd-sale-of-the-day 500** — `generateReferenceNumber` filtered existing refs with `startsWith` on a prefix that still contained the literal `#` placeholder, so the count was always 0 and every auto-ref was `…-001` → `(tenant_id, reference_number)` unique-constraint collision. Rewrote to take the max existing sequence for the day's literal prefix and increment (`sales.service.ts`). Verified by driving the running Docker app with Playwright: 4 sales created (Cash/Card/Mobile Wallet), all 201/COMPLETED, accounting vouchers posted, persisted in the Sales list; updated `sales.service.spec.ts` tx mock (`sale.findMany`); products+sales specs 22/22 green — done 2026-06-22
- [x] New Sale UI review fixes — (1) the global floating Feedback widget was covering the Create Sale button: lifted the right-panel action bar above it (`lg:pb-16` desktop, `pb-20` mobile). (2) Payment methods now reflect the Payment Methods management definition: `PaymentSection` loads `api.getPaymentMethods()` and shows the tenant's *active* methods as quick-add chips (by their real names, sorted), auto-linking each method's account; inactive methods + the 4 generic types live behind an "Other ▾" menu; falls back to the generic 4 when none are defined. To keep accounting posting correct (backend classifies by substring on the method string), the submitted `method` stays canonical (Cash/Mobile Wallet/Card/Bank) derived from the method `type`, with a new optional `Payment.label` carrying the friendly name for display. (3) Mobile responsiveness: below `lg` the page now flows and scrolls naturally (the POS fixed-viewport/internal-scroll behavior applies only at `lg+`), and the action bar clears the fixed widgets — verified at 1440px (no overflow) and 390px (form scrolls, all controls reachable) — done 2026-06-22
- [x] Accounting-focused subscription pack — added a new `ACCOUNTING` plan code (between BASIC and STANDARD, ৳749/mo) targeting bookkeeping-only customers. Approach: "just the plan, gate nothing new" — no module gates were changed. The plan's `features_json` sets `premiumAccounting: true` (unlocks the feature-gated `/accounting` module), while expenses/payment-methods/cost-centers/loans are already ungated so they work on any active subscription. Changes: `SubscriptionPlanCode` enum + migration `20260620000000_add_accounting_plan`; `SubscriptionPlanCode`/`AI_CREDITS_PER_PLAN` in shared-types; `PLAN_RANK` (ACCOUNTING=0, so it never unlocks BASIC/STANDARD `@RequiresPlan` routes outside accounting scope) + `PlanCode` type in `subscription-access.guard.ts`; seed plan in `seed.ts`; widened `planCode` unions/`@IsIn` in billing/admin-tenants/auth DTOs + services so it's assignable & self-serve purchasable; frontend marketing plans + comparison column, signup/admin/billing plan selectors, en/bn/ms admin labels. Backend builds clean; frontend typechecks clean (only pre-existing `.test.tsx` errors remain) — done 2026-06-20
- [x] Redesign New Sale entry UI to be compact and fit on screen without scrolling — replaced the seven stacked `p-6` white cards (which forced page scrolling) with a POS-style full-height two-column layout mirroring `pos/page.tsx`: a slim top strip (back + title + inline Sales#/Ref#/User/Date meta), a left work area (inline card-less Customer search/chip + Product search, a flex-grow line-items table that is the *only* internal scroll region with a sticky header and denser rows — Product-ID column dropped, plus a one-line optional note field), and a fixed ~320px right panel holding the dense totals summary (discount %, transport, labor, rounding as inline inputs on their value rows), the narrow stacked Payment section, and Cancel/Print/Create actions pinned to the bottom. Below `lg` the panel stacks under the work area and the page may scroll (mobile). Pure presentation refactor of `sales/new/page.tsx` + its 6 components; no changes to `useNewSaleCart`, totals calc, validation, submit, or print. Typecheck clean for all sales/new files — done 2026-06-21
- [x] Get the E2E (Playwright) suite green — it had never actually run (the CI job never started the frontend), so the specs had drifted from the app. Fixes: started the frontend in the E2E workflow + waited on it; associated `<label>`s with inputs on login/signup (a11y; unblocks `getByLabel`); added a Playwright `globalSetup` that provisions the canonical E2E account via the signup API (idempotent + retry for the provisioning transaction-timeout); seeded subscription plans in the E2E DB (signup needs a valid plan); made the API throttler limit env-configurable and raised it for E2E (the sidebar route sweep was tripping 429s and cascading); aligned stale specs with real behaviour (native HTML5 validation, `/verify-email` redirect, unique `/your name/i` locators, server-side-only auth protection, disabled-but-present POS checkout button); fixed a real storefront-dashboard crash (`data.items` undefined → guard); unified E2E credentials. Result: full pipeline green — E2E 73 passed. PR #285. (Note: E2E does not gate Render deploys.) — done 2026-06-17
- [x] Fix backend Render deploy failing in pre-deploy DB sync — the New Sales feature added `@@unique([tenant_id, reference_number])` on `Sale`, and `prisma db push` aborts with "Use the --accept-data-loss flag" when adding a unique constraint. The Docker image builds/pushes fine; the deploy exited status 1 during the `preDeployCommand`. Added `--accept-data-loss` to both `prisma db push` invocations (render.yaml `preDeployCommand` + backend Dockerfile start CMD). Safe here: `reference_number` is a newly-added nullable column so all existing rows are NULL, and Postgres treats NULLs as distinct in unique indexes — no rows conflict, nothing is dropped — done 2026-06-17
- [x] Fix failing CI/CD pipeline that blocked Render deploys (backend + frontend) — Render gates deploys on the shared `CI/CD Pipeline` passing, so multiple test/build failures across the last two commits (`0d0ce5f` price lists, `468e54a` New Sales page) blocked **both** services. Root causes & fixes: (1) **Real backend build breakers** — `payment-methods` + `sales-settings` modules (controllers/services/modules) from `468e54a` were authored against non-existent conventions (`@/shared/...` path alias, `PrismaService`); rewrote them to repo conventions (`DatabaseService`, `../auth/jwt-auth.guard`, `../database/tenant.interceptor`, `Tenant`/`TenantContext` decorator with `@UseInterceptors(TenantInterceptor)`, `DatabaseModule`) — these `TS2307` errors would have failed `nest build` in the Docker image. (2) `products.service.spec.ts` missing new `PriceListsService` dep. (3) `sales.service.spec.ts` tx mock missing `salesSettings.findUnique` + `sale.count` (new reference-number generation) and a payment assertion missing `account_id`. (4) `auth.service.spec.ts` `db.account` mock missing `findFirst` (pre-existing break from the loan-posting `ensureLoanPostingSetup`). (5) Frontend `settings/page.test.tsx` lucide-react mock missing the new `ShoppingBag`/`CreditCard` icons. Verified: `nest build` clean, all 5 affected specs pass, full frontend suite 1290/1290, lint exit 0 — done 2026-06-17
- [x] Platform admin "Add New Tenant" (manual signup on behalf of a customer) — `POST /admin/tenants` + `GET /admin/users/lookup` on `AdminTenantsController`/`AdminUsersController` (both `JwtAuthGuard + PlatformAdminGuard`); `CreateAdminTenantDto` with `ownerMode: new|existing`. `AdminTenantsService.createTenant` provisions tenant + OWNER `TenantUser` + store + TRIALING 14-day subscription (chosen `planCode`) + `UserStoreAccess` + OWNER `UserStorePermission`s + default accounting in one `$transaction`, plus optional business-type template seed. New-user path creates the user inside the tx with a throwaway bcrypt hash (passwordHash is non-nullable) and a `PasswordResetToken`, then emails a reset link so the owner sets their own password; existing-user path reuses the looked-up user. Audit-logged as `tenant.admin_create`. Frontend: "New Tenant" button + create modal on `/dashboard/admin/tenants` (New/Existing-user tabs with email lookup, tenant/store/address/business-type/plan fields), `createAdminTenant`/`lookupAdminUser` API client methods, i18n en/bn/ms. Spec + plan in `docs/superpowers/` — done 2026-06-17
- [x] Basic loan management — track money the business has borrowed (PAYABLE) or lent out (RECEIVABLE) with repayment recording and outstanding-balance tracking. New `Loan` + `LoanPayment` Prisma models and migration `20260615000000_add_loans` (also adds `VIEW_LOANS`/`MANAGE_LOANS` to the `StorePermission` enum); `loans` NestJS module (controller/service/dto) registered in `app.module.ts` with full tenant-scoped CRUD, `POST /loans/:id/payments` (validates against outstanding, auto-closes a fully-repaid loan), `DELETE /loans/:id/payments/:paymentId` (re-opens), and `GET /loans/summary`. Added `VIEW_LOANS`/`MANAGE_LOANS` to shared-types permission matrix (labels, role defaults for OWNER/MANAGER/ACCOUNTANT, Accounting & Funds group). Frontend: `/dashboard/loans` page (summary cards, type/status filters, add/edit modal, detail modal with repayment ledger), API client methods, sidebar link under Accounting, and en/bn/ms localization — done 2026-06-15
- [x] Loan automatic journal postings — wired loans into the posting-rules engine. Added `loan_disbursement`/`loan_repayment` event types + a `loan_direction` condition key (schema enums, migration `20260616000000_add_loan_posting`, shared-types, posting DTO validation, `posting.utils` union + JOURNAL voucher mapping). Added `Loans Payable` (2020) and `Loans Receivable` (1030) accounts plus 4 default posting rules to the accounting bootstrap, exposed via an idempotent `ensureLoanPostingSetup` so existing tenants get them lazily on first loan activity. Creating a loan posts a disbursement voucher and recording a repayment posts a repayment voucher (correct Dr/Cr per direction), inside a transaction via the existing idempotent engine; posting-rules UI shows the new event/condition labels. Covered by `loans.service.spec.ts` + updated `bootstrap-accounting.spec.ts`. Known limitation: deleting a loan/payment does not auto-reverse its voucher (manual reversing entry, consistent with the rest of the system) — done 2026-06-16

- [x] Automatic journal postings for expense entries — added `expense` to `PostingRuleEventType` enum (schema + migration 13), wired `autoPostFromRules` into `ExpensesService.createEntry()` using a DB transaction with `payment_mode` condition (cash/bank), added default expense posting rules (debit Expense, credit Cash/Bank) to `bootstrapDefaultAccountingForTenant` — done 2026-06-16

- [x] Department & Designation management — dedicated UI pages at `/dashboard/employees/departments` and `/dashboard/employees/designations` with full create/edit/delete (soft-delete with employee assignment guard); backend PATCH/DELETE endpoints added to `EmployeesController`; sidebar links added; i18n for en/bn/ms; employee add/edit forms already had department/designation selects — done 2026-06-15

- [x] Platform Admin vs shop login separation + workspace chooser — platform admins no longer see shop owner/user sidebar options: introduced a "login context" concept (`active_context` localStorage = `platform-admin` for the admin console, otherwise a tenant). After login, `storeAuthResponse` resolves contexts: a single shop or admin-only goes straight in, but when more than one workspace exists (admin email that also owns a shop, or a user belonging to multiple shops) the user is sent to a new `/select-account` chooser to pick the Platform Admin Console or a specific shop. `Sidebar` gets `platformAdminMode` (renders only admin + help) and a "Switch account" link (`canSwitchAccount`); `dashboard/layout` derives admin mode, hides the branch selector / shop onboarding in admin mode, labels the user as "Platform Admin", and routes `/dashboard` → `/dashboard/admin`. Frontend-only — `getMe()` already returns `is_platform_admin` + `tenants[]` — done 2026-06-15

- [x] Fix production login 500 (full resolution) — root cause was Prisma schema drift on fresh DB: preDeployCommand (`prisma db push`) was silently failing because DIRECT_URL (external hostname) is blocked by Render's IP allowlist when connecting from within the container; fixed by overriding `DIRECT_URL=$DATABASE_URL` in Dockerfile CMD so prisma uses the internal Render hostname; also moved `npm run db:seed` into Dockerfile CMD so schema sync + seeding runs at startup (idempotent) before NestJS receives traffic; production DB was recreated fresh (old DB `dpg-d8kiaj6q1p3s73fkmum0-a` deleted, new DB `dpg-d8ndt967r5hc73anmdk0-a`) — done 2026-06-14

- [x] Fix demo login (`POST /auth/demo`) returning 500 in Docker — root cause: `packages/database/index.js` (stale committed compiled file) never exported `DEMO_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` from `seed-demo.ts`, so the constant was `undefined` in the running container; fixed by inlining the constant in `index.js` — done 2026-06-14

- [x] Nightly read-only E2E monitoring — every midnight Bangladesh time a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/nightly-readonly-e2e.yml`, cron `0 18 * * *`) runs the `@readonly`-tagged Playwright suite against the live deployment (`https://erp71-frontend.onrender.com`) to confirm all feature routes and read-only flows are up. Tagged 69 read-only cases across `sidebar-routes`/`auth`/`billing`/`pos` specs and parameterized their base URLs + login via env (`PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`, `E2E_API_URL`, `E2E_TEST_EMAIL/PASSWORD`); data-mutating cases (signup, complete-sale, critical-path) are excluded so prod data is never touched. `scripts/format-e2e-report.js` turns the Playwright JSON report into an email subject + HTML body that lists every failed case, sent to nayeem.ahmad@gmail.com via Brevo SMTP. Requires repo secrets (`E2E_TEST_EMAIL/PASSWORD`, `SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASS`, `EMAIL_FROM`) — done 2026-06-14

- [x] Pre-populated products by business type (surgical/medical) — 1,173 real products from Care Force Medical PDF classified into 24 groups / 104 subgroups; `packages/database/prisma/templates/surgical-medical.json` (194KB) + `seed-template.ts` with `seedBusinessTypeTemplate(prisma, tenantId, businessType)`; `business_type` field added to Tenant schema (migration `20260614000000_add_business_type_to_tenant`); seeder auto-triggered in `setupTenant` after registration; onboarding UI shows 4 business type tiles (surgical/medical live, others "coming soon") — done 2026-06-14

- [x] Fix 12 failing nightly E2E tests — two root causes: (1) Auth heading mismatches: `auth.spec.ts` heading regexes updated to match actual i18n text ("Welcome back", "Create your ERP71 workspace", "Create workspace"); `loginIfNeeded()` in `billing.spec.ts` and `pos.spec.ts` rewritten to use URL check instead of heading detection, fixing silently-skipped login that caused billing/POS tests to fail; (2) Sidebar `/500/` false positive: the broad `/500/` pattern in `FATAL_PATTERNS` matched monetary values like ৳500 and loyalty points — changed to narrow `/500\s*\|\s*internal server error/i`; also fixed `selected_tenant_id`/`selected_store_id` localStorage keys to `tenant_id`/`store_id` matching what `fetchWithAuth` and `storeAuthResponse` actually use — done 2026-06-14

- [x] Utilize full content width on dashboard screens — removed centered max-width caps (`max-w-[1400px]`, `max-w-6xl/5xl/4xl`, `max-w-[1000px]/[1100px]`) on 58 table/report/dashboard pages so they fill the available width to the right of the sidebar (the outer `p-6` wrapper keeps margins); single-column forms (settings, platform-settings), detail/invoice documents, and print pages intentionally left at a readable width — done 2026-06-14
- [x] Prepaid SMS credit balance & top-up — shops buy SMS credits that are deducted whenever an SMS is sent. Schema: `Tenant.sms_credits`, `SmsPackage`, `SmsTransaction` (ledger) + migration `20260612010000_add_sms_credits`; `SmsCreditService` (segment-aware billing, atomic `consume`, purchase/confirm) + `SmsCreditController` (`GET /sms-credits/summary`, `POST /sms-credits/purchase`, `POST /sms-credits/confirm`); `SmsService.sendSms` now deducts credits per recipient×segment and skips sending when out of balance; wired into sale receipts, low-stock alerts, and CRM campaigns; seed adds 4 packages + 1,000 starter credits; frontend balance/top-up/history page at `/dashboard/sms-credits` + sidebar link — done 2026-06-12

- [x] POS compact view — added gallery/compact toggle (LayoutGrid / List icons) next to the search bar; compact view renders a dense single-column list with thumbnail, name, SKU, stock badge, price, and a + button; gallery view unchanged — done 2026-06-11

- [x] Platform settings for SMS, Email, and payment gateways — `PlatformSetting` DB model + migration `20260611000000_add_platform_settings`; `PlatformSettingsModule` (global, `@Global()`) with AES-256-GCM encryption for secrets; `GET/PATCH /admin/platform-settings/:group` endpoints guarded by `PlatformAdminGuard`; test endpoints for SMS and email; `SmsService` and `EmailService` refactored to read credentials from `PlatformSettingsService` (with 60s in-memory cache + env var fallback); admin frontend pages at `/dashboard/admin/platform-settings/{sms,email,payments,general}` with masked secret display and "Send Test" buttons; Platform Settings link added to admin overview — done 2026-06-11

- [x] Add accounting features 8-15 (Fiscal Period Locking, Opening Balance Import, Budget vs Actual, Cost Centers, Fixed Assets & Depreciation, Recurring Journals, Bank Reconciliation, Audit Trail) — 21 service methods inserted before buildBookReport, 22 controller endpoints appended, controller DTO imports updated, createVoucher now passes userId for audit logging, accounting.module.ts updated with AuditService — done 2026-06-11

- [x] Add 7 accounting report endpoints (Trial Balance, AR Aging, AP Aging, Comparative P&L, VAT/Tax Report, Financial Ratios, Cash Flow Statement) — DTOs already in accounting.dto.ts; added 7 service methods to AccountingService before buildBookReport; added 7 GET controller endpoints under reports/; updated controller DTO import block — done 2026-06-11

- [x] Add Prisma schema models for accounting mid-size features: FiscalPeriod, AccountBudget, CostCenter, FixedAsset, AssetDepreciationEntry, RecurringJournal, RecurringJournalLine, BankReconciliation, BankStatementEntry; added DepreciationMethod enum; updated Tenant, Account, VoucherDetail relations; created SQL migration files 07–12 — done 2026-06-11

- [x] Brand management — Brand CRUD (POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /brands), Brand model in Prisma with soft delete, EDIT_BRANDS permission, brand select on product create/edit modal, Brands page at /dashboard/brands, sidebar nav link under Inventory Setup — done 2026-06-10

- [x] Add `created_by` (userId) to all entry models — Sale, Purchase, PurchaseReturn, SalesReturn, SalesOrder, PurchaseOrder now store the creating user's ID; schema updated, migration `20260610020000_add_created_by_to_entries`, Prisma client regenerated, all 6 service `create()` methods and controllers updated — done 2026-06-10

- [x] Multi-branch consolidated reporting + branch-level report — VIEW_CONSOLIDATED_REPORTS permission enforced (OWNER/ACCOUNTANT only); new GET /sales-reports/branch-report endpoint; Branch Report frontend page at /dashboard/reports/branch-report with store selector, KPIs, top products, daily breakdown, and company revenue comparison — done 2026-06-09
- [x] Audit `SubscriptionAccessGuard` — found ManufacturingController, AttendanceController, ApiKeysController unprotected; added SubscriptionAccessGuard + @RequiresPlan('STANDARD') to manufacturing and attendance, @RequiresFeature('apiAccess') to api-keys; 16 controller integration tests covering STANDARD/PREMIUM allow, BASIC/FREE/PAST_DUE reject, non-member 401 — done 2026-06-09

- [x] Session invalidation on password change — changePassword() now increments token_version alongside the password hash; JWT strategy already checked tv so all existing sessions are immediately invalidated; 7 new unit tests — done 2026-06-09

- [x] Dunning management — BillingSchedulerService daily cron (09:00) finds PAST_DUE subscriptions past the grace period (default 7 days, DUNNING_GRACE_DAYS env), downgrades them to FREE/CANCELLED, sends sendSubscriptionCancelled email, logs audit event; 11 unit tests; DUNNING_GRACE_DAYS configurable — done 2026-06-09
- [x] Transactional emails: billing invoices, payment confirmations, payment failures — EmailService injected into BillingService; invoice email sent on ACTIVE paid plan; failure email sent on PAST_DUE; fire-and-forget so SMTP errors never block payment flow; 13 new unit tests covering all paths — done 2026-06-09
- [x] Implement audit logging table — migration `20260609020000_add_audit_log_table`; AuditService with `log()` and `query()` methods; AuditController `GET /audit-logs` (tenant-scoped); wired into AuthService (signup, login, login-fail, logout, password-change), PasswordResetService (reset-requested, reset-completed), and BillingService (subscription-changed) — done 2026-06-09
- [x] Confirmed `.env` never in git history — only placeholder `.env.example` committed; no real secrets exposed, no rotation required — done 2026-06-09
- [x] Persist production Prisma enum alignment after VPS redeploy — added `MANAGE_COUNTERS` to Prisma `StorePermission` and guarded the POS counters migration enum change with `IF NOT EXISTS` so source control now matches the live VPS schema — done 2026-06-09
- [x] Storefront loyalty points — customers earn points automatically on every authenticated order; can redeem points for a discount at checkout; points balance displayed in checkout with toggle; `GET /storefront/:slug` now exposes loyalty program settings; `placeOrder` handles earn/redeem in a single DB transaction — done 2026-06-09
- [x] Storefront customer sign up / sign in — new `POST /storefront/:slug/auth/signup` and `POST /storefront/:slug/auth/login` endpoints; Customer model now has optional `user_id` link to User; StorefrontOrder tracks `customerUserId` for authenticated orders; frontend sign-in and sign-up pages at `/store/[slug]/auth/signin` and `/store/[slug]/auth/signup`; header on both storefront pages shows account menu / Sign In button; checkout pre-fills and attaches auth token when signed in; migration `20260609000000_customer_user_link` — done 2026-06-09
