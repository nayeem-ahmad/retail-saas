# Epic 01: SaaS Foundation & Infrastructure (Multi-Store Ready)

**Goal:** This epic focuses on establishing the technical and structural foundation of the Retail SaaS platform with full multi-store/multi-branch support. By the end of this epic, the development environment will be fully operational, and the application will support multi-tenant, multi-store architectures with granular permission-based access control.

## Stories

### [1.1] Project & Infrastructure Setup
*   **User Story:** As a DevOps Engineer, I want to set up the initial monorepo, CI/CD pipeline, and cloud infrastructure, so that the development team can start building and deploying the application.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A Git monorepo is created with `apps/web` and `packages/shared-types` using npm workspaces.
    2.  Vercel is linked for deployment of the `apps/web` (Next.js App Router).
    3.  `.env.local` is configured with Supabase connection strings from the PRD.
*   **Technical Context:** Next.js 14+ (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript.

### [1.2] Database Schema & RLS Foundation (Multi-Store)
*   **User Story:** As a Shop Owner with multiple stores, I want my data to be strictly isolated per store, so that each branch's business information is secure and accessible only to authorized users.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  `User`, `Tenant`, `Store`, `UserStoreAccess`, and `UserStorePermission` tables created.
    2.  PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies implemented on all transaction tables using `tenant_id` and `store_id`.
    3.  Master data tables (products, suppliers, customers) use `tenant_id` only (shared across stores).
    4.  `UserStorePermission` table introduced for granular permission-based access control.
    5.  A `current_tenant_id()` and `current_store_id()` helper functions created in the database for RLS.
    6.  `ProductPrice` table created to support store-specific pricing overrides.
*   **Technical Context:** Supabase, PostgreSQL, RLS, Permission-based RBAC.

### [1.3] Multi-Tenant, Multi-Store Auth & Sign-up Flow
*   **User Story:** As a new Shop Owner, I want to sign up and create my first store profile in one step, so that I can quickly start using the system. I should also be able to add more stores later without creating new accounts.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  Sign-up page handles Supabase Auth registration.
    2.  Post-registration flow automatically creates a `tenant` (organization) and an initial `store`.
    3.  Creates a `UserStoreAccess` record with `access_level = STORE_ONLY` for Cashier or `MULTI_STORE_CAPABLE` for Owner.
    4.  Seeds default permissions based on owner role (all permissions granted).
    5.  Login endpoint returns list of accessible stores; if user has access to multiple stores, store selector is presented.
    6.  User can switch between stores post-login via dropdown (updates API headers).
    7.  User redirected to dashboard with current store context established.
*   **Technical Context:** Supabase Auth, Next.js Server Actions, Multi-store context.

### [1.4] Permission-Based Access Control & Multi-Store Invitations
*   **User Story:** As a Shop Owner, I want to invite employees to one or multiple stores and assign them granular permissions (not just roles), so that I can have fine-grained control over what each user can do at each store.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  Permission enum created (EDIT_PRODUCTS, CREATE_SALE, APPROVE_GOODS_TRANSFER, VIEW_CONSOLIDATED_REPORTS, etc.).
    2.  `UserStoreAccess` table enforces user-to-store assignments with `access_level` (STORE_ONLY or MULTI_STORE_CAPABLE).
    3.  `UserStorePermission` table allows granular permission assignment per user per store.
    4.  Role-to-permission seeding provided (OWNER = all permissions; MANAGER, CASHIER, ACCOUNTANT = limited presets).
    5.  Store selector UI appears for users with access to multiple stores.
    6.  Middleware/Guards verify permissions on every request.
    7.  Cashiers can be assigned to multiple stores (e.g., weekend coverage).
*   **Technical Context:** Permission-based RBAC, Next.js Middleware, Guards.

### [1.5] API Foundation & Global Error Handling
*   **User Story:** As a Developer, I want a standardized way to handle API calls and errors, so that our application is robust and easy to maintain.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  `apiClient` wrapper implemented in `lib/api.ts` with error handling.
    2.  `withErrorHandler` HOC/Wrapper for API routes to return standard `ApiError` JSON.
    3.  Zod schemas used for all request body validation.
*   **Technical Context:** Zod, TypeScript, Fetch API.
